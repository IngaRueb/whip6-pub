This application serves the purpose of verifing whether uart is able to read a single byte in the blocking manner.

Two seconds after powering the board the application makes a call to start reading. When the device awaits a character to be entered by a user, the *yellow* led is on. When the application receives an input byte from a user, the character is compared with 'y'. After two seconds the application makes another call to read and the process is repeated.

*************
