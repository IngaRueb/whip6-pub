This simple app uses Sensor Controller UART to send test data according to these rules:

- DATA_TO_SEND megabytes (10^6 bytes) are sent through the SC UART
- each lines starts with a control number that cycles from '0' to '9' followed by a space
- then a string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ " is sent
- the last character of the line cycles from '!' (ASCII 33) to '@' (ASCII 64)
- that gives blocks of size 57 * 32 = 1824 that allow discovery of loss of consecutive bytes
  (if not happening too often or is longer than block size)

Baud rate is configurable by BAUD_RATE variable in Prv module.
