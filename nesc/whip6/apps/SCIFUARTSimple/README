This simple app uses Sensor Controller UART to send test data according to these rules:

- NUM_OF_LINES lines are sent through the SC UART
- each lines starts with "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ "
- the last character of the line cycles from '!' (ASCII 33) to '@' (ASCII 64)
- that gives blocks of size 59 * 32 = 1888 that allow discovery of loss of consecutive bytes
  (if not happening too often or is longer than block size)

Baud rate is configurable by BAUD_RATE variable in Prv module.
