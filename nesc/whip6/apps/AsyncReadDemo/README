This application serves the purpose of verifing whether uart is able to read a single byte asynchronously.

Every three seconds the application makes a call to start reading. Immediately afterwards it toggles a value of a local character variable. As soon as the user provides the input, the application compares the received byte with the local variable.

*************
How to use it
*************
1. Install the application.
2. Start minicom (make sure you have connected minicom correctly to the device).
3. Reset the board.
4. If the *yellow* led is on, enter a single 'a' character in the minicom terminal; observe the *orange* led and the *green* one.
5. Otherwise, if the *yellow* led is off, enter 'b' in the minicom terminal; observe the *orange* led and the *green* one.
6. Then, try entering multiple characters at once; observe the *orange* led.
7. Wait for a half of minute and enter multiple characters at once; observe the *orange* led.

****************
Expected outcome
****************
Ad 4., 5.:
- Every time a user enters the proper character, the *orange* led and the *green* led toggle. If the character does not match the local value, only the *orange* led toggles.
Ad 6.:
- The *orange* led should toggle once no matter how many characters are entered during a three-second interval between consecutive calls to uart.
Ad 7.
- The *orange* led should toggle once despite the fact that the application made more than one call to uart during a half-minute interval.
- The *red* led should be on to designate that the uart is busy (it keeps waiting for input after the first call).

**********************
How to diagnose errors
**********************
Ad 4., 5.:
- The *red* led is on and the *orange* led stop toggling after a single character is entered: make sure the interrupt UART_INT_RX is handled properly in the implementation of AsyncRead.
- The *red* led is off and the *orange* led does not toggle after characters are entered: make sure the event "readDone" is signalled by the implementation of AsyncRead.
- The *orange* led toggles but the *green* led does not: uart received a different character than expected.
Ad 6.:
- The *orange* led toggles multiple times: the implementation of AsyncRead reads more than one byte after a single call.
Ad 7.:
- The *orange* led toggles multiple times and the *red* led is on: AsyncRead reads more than one byte after a single call.
- The *orange* led toggles multiple times and the *red* led is off: the implementation of AsyncRead "hoards" calls to uart.
- The *yellow* led toggled only once: most probably, AsyncRead is blocking.
